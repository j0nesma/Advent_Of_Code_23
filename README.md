# Advent of Code with ChatGPT and Me

🎄🦌Keeping my little nogging working while I am egg nogging🦌🎄

## How It Works

Using the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) website to solve coding puzzles.

I will be solving using Javascript this year.

1. **Puzzle Solving**: Each day, I approach the puzzle first, brainstorming and coding initial ideas.

2. **ChatGPT** I give ChatGPT the same questions and see if it successed after 3 attempts at corrections
